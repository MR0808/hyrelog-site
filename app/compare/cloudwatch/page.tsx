          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            Cloud logging services (e.g. CloudWatch, Cloud Logging) give you centralized logs and
            search. They’re not built to provide tamper-evident audit trails with hash-chain
            integrity, guaranteed data residency, and long-term retention for auditors.

            <h2>What cloud logging is good for</h2>
            <p>
              Centralized collection, search, and alerting on application and infrastructure logs.
              Retention and region are configurable but the primary use case is operations, not
              compliance evidence.
            </p>
            <h2>What auditors need</h2>
            <p>
              Auditors need to see that your audit trail is <strong>immutable</strong> (e.g.
              hash-chained), retained for a defined period, and stored in the right region. They
              want exportable evidence, not just “we have logs in the cloud.”
            </p>
            <h2>HyreLog’s focus</h2>
            <p>
              HyreLog is built for audit logging: tamper-evident storage, multi-region residency,
              retention policies, and exports that meet compliance expectations. You can keep
              using your cloud provider for general logging and add HyreLog for the audit trail.
