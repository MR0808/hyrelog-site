          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            Observability tools (e.g. Datadog, New Relic, Grafana) help you understand and debug
            your systems with logs, metrics, and traces. They’re not designed to be tamper-evident
            audit trails with guaranteed data residency and long retention.

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert mt-8 max-w-none">
            <h2>When observability is the right tool</h2>
            <p>
              Use observability platforms for operational insight: latency, errors, request flows,
              and recent logs. Retention is often short; the goal is debugging and alerting, not
              legal or compliance evidence.
            </p>
            <h2>When you need an audit log</h2>
            <p>
              For SOC 2, GDPR, and security reviews, auditors expect an <strong>audit trail</strong>:
              who did what, when, and where, with cryptographic integrity (e.g. hash chains),
              defined retention, and data residency. That’s a different design than general-purpose
              observability.
            </p>
            <h2>Using both</h2>
            <p>
              Many teams use observability for operations and a dedicated audit-logging product for
              compliance. HyreLog focuses on the latter: immutable, region-aware audit trails and
              auditor-ready exports.
