# Build vs Buy: Choosing an Audit Trail Service

Every organisation needs audit trails for security, compliance, and operational visibility. The question is: should you build this capability yourself or use a dedicated audit trail service? This decision has significant implications for your team's time, your system's architecture, and your ability to meet compliance requirements. Let's explore the factors to consider.

## The Core Requirements

Before deciding, understand what you actually need:

### Functional Requirements

-   **Event Logging**: Capture events from your applications
-   **Immutable Storage**: Ensure logs can't be modified
-   **Querying**: Search and filter events by various criteria
-   **Retention**: Store logs for required periods (often years)
-   **Export**: Generate reports and export data for auditors
-   **Monitoring**: Alert on suspicious patterns
-   **Integration**: Easy integration with your applications

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance**: Handle high event volumes without impacting application performance
-   **Reliability**: Never lose events, even during failures
-   **Security**: Protect logs from unauthorised access
-   **Scalability**: Grow with your organisation
-   **Compliance**: Meet SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA requirements

## Building In-House: The Reality

Building a production-grade audit trail system is more complex than it might seem:

### What You Need to Build

**Event Ingestion API**: A service that accepts events from your applications:

-   REST API or message queue interface
-   Authentication and authorisation
-   Rate limiting and throttling
-   Validation and normalisation
-   High availability and load balancing

**Storage System**: Immutable, scalable storage:

-   Hash chain implementation for tamper detection
-   Efficient indexing for querying
-   Retention management
-   Backup and disaster recovery
-   Multi-region support (for compliance)

**Query Interface**: API for retrieving events:

-   Complex query capabilities
-   Pagination and filtering
-   Performance optimisation
-   Access control

**Monitoring and Alerting**: Detect suspicious activity:

-   Real-time event processing
-   Pattern detection
-   Alerting infrastructure
-   Dashboard and visualisation

**Compliance Features**: Meet regulatory requirements:

-   Tamper-evident storage
-   Audit log of audit logs
-   Retention policy enforcement
-   Compliance reporting

### The Hidden Costs

**Development Time**: Building all of this takes significant engineering time:

-   Initial development: 3-6 months for a small team
-   Ongoing maintenance: 20-30% of a developer's time
-   Bug fixes and improvements: Continuous

**Operational Overhead**: Running the system requires:

-   Infrastructure costs (servers, storage, networking)
-   Monitoring and alerting
-   Backup and disaster recovery
-   Security updates and patches
-   Scaling and performance tuning

**Expertise Required**: You need expertise in:

-   Cryptography (hash chains, digital signatures)
-   Distributed systems
-   Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)
-   High-performance storage systems
-   Security best practices

**Opportunity Cost**: Time spent building audit trails is time not spent on:

-   Core product features
-   Customer-facing improvements
-   Competitive differentiation

### Common Pitfalls

**Underestimating Complexity**: Many teams underestimate how complex audit trails are:

-   "We'll just log to a database" (doesn't meet immutability requirements)
-   "We'll add it later" (much harder to retrofit)
-   "It's just logging" (compliance requirements are strict)

**Performance Issues**: Audit logging can impact application performance:

-   Synchronous logging blocks requests
-   Storage becomes a bottleneck
-   Query performance degrades with scale

**Compliance Gaps**: Missing requirements:

-   Not implementing hash chains (can't prove immutability)
-   Insufficient retention policies
-   Missing access controls
-   No audit log of audit logs

**Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing maintenance is significant:

-   Scaling issues
-   Performance optimisation
-   Security updates
-   Compliance changes

## Making the Decision

Here's a framework for making the decision:

### Score Your Requirements

Rate each requirement (1-5):

-   **Criticality**: How important is this requirement?
-   **Complexity**: How hard is it to build?
-   **Uniqueness**: How unique are your needs?

### Evaluate Build Option

-   **Development Time**: How long to build?
-   **Ongoing Maintenance**: What's the maintenance burden?
-   **Total Cost**: Development + operations + opportunity cost
-   **Risk**: What if you get it wrong?

### Evaluate Buy Option

-   **Feature Fit**: Does the service meet your needs?
-   **Integration Effort**: How easy to integrate?
-   **Total Cost**: Subscription + integration + migration
-   **Risk**: What if the service fails or changes?

### Consider Hybrid Approaches

You might not need to choose exclusively:

-   **Core Events**: Use a service for critical compliance events
-   **Operational Events**: Build simple logging for operational events
-   **Gradual Migration**: Start with a service, build later if needed

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Engineering

Building more than you need:

-   Complex features you'll never use
-   Premature optimisation
-   Over-architecting for scale you don't have

### Under-Engineering

Building less than you need:

-   Missing compliance requirements
-   Poor performance
-   Insufficient reliability
-   Security gaps

### Ignoring Total Cost

Focusing only on subscription cost:

-   Not considering development time
-   Ignoring operational overhead
-   Missing opportunity cost
-   Underestimating maintenance

### Vendor Lock-in Concerns

Worrying too much about lock-in:

-   Audit logs are exportable
-   Standards-based APIs
-   Can migrate if needed
-   Premature optimisation

## Recommendation

For most organisations, **buying is the right choice**:

-   **Faster**: Get audit trails working in days, not months
-   **Better**: Services have expertise you don't
-   **Cheaper**: Total cost is usually lower
-   **Lower Risk**: Proven solutions vs. building from scratch

Build only if:

-   You have very unique requirements
-   You're operating at extreme scale
-   You have strict data residency requirements
-   You have excess engineering capacity

## Conclusion

The build vs. buy decision for audit trails is significant. While building gives you full control, it requires substantial engineering effort, ongoing maintenance, and deep expertise. Buying a service like HyreLog gets you production-ready audit trails quickly, with built-in compliance and best practices.

Most organisations should buy. The time, cost, and risk savings usually outweigh the benefits of building yourself. Focus your engineering team on your core product, and let dedicated services handle infrastructure like audit trails.

If you're evaluating services, focus on functional capabilities, security and compliance, performance, developer experience, and pricing. And remember: you can always build later if your needs change, but you can't get back the time spent building something you could have bought.
